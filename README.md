# Ford-App

This is a repository where we try to figure out the architecture, folder structure, and dependencies that we need to follow in the initial state of the Ford project development

This is a React application that uses Redux for state management. The app is built using the latest version of React and utilizes the `react-dom/client` API to render the application.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Architecture

The application is structured around the following components:

* `App.jsx`: The main application component that renders the UI.
* `store/store.js`: The Redux store that manages the application's state.
* `index.js`: The entry point of the application that sets up the React DOM and renders the App component.

## Folder Structure

* `node_modules/`: The dependencies folder (managed by npm or yarn).
* `src/`: The source code folder.
	+ `App.jsx`: The main application component.
	+ `store/`: The Redux store folder.
		- `store.js`: The Redux store configuration.
	+ `index.js`: The entry point of the application.
	+ `index.css`: The global stylesheet for the application.
* `build/`: The production build folder (generated by `npm run build`).
* `package.json`: The project's package file, which contains metadata for the project, including dependencies and scripts.
* `README.md`: This file, which provides information about the project and its structure.
* `.eslintrc.json`: The ESLint configuration file.
* `.prettierrc.json`: The Prettier configuration file.
* `vite.config.js`: The Vite configuration file.
* `tailwind.config.js`: The Tailwind CSS configuration file.
* `postcss.config.js`: The PostCSS configuration file.
* `jest.config.js`: The Jest configuration file.
* `tests/`: The folder for unit tests.
    + `setup.js`: The setup file for Jest tests.

To install all these dependencies, run the following command:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @eslint/js @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/react @types/react @types/react-dom @vitejs/plugin-react autoprefixer eslint eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks eslint-plugin-react-refresh globals jsdom npm-audit-html postcss prettier tailwindcss vite vitest
```

## Scripts

The project uses the following scripts:

* `dev`: Starts the development server.
* `build`: Builds the application for production.
* `lint`: Runs the ESLint code linter.
* `fixlint`: Fixes ESLint errors and warnings.
* `preview`: Starts the production server.
* `audit`: Runs the npm audit tool to check for vulnerabilities.
* `test`: Runs the unit tests using Vitest.
* `test:ui`: Runs the unit tests using Vitest with the UI.

**Getting Started**

To get started with the project, run the following commands:

`npm install` to install the dependencies.

`npm run dev` to start the development server.

This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.

**Building the Application**

To build the application for production, run the following command:

`npm run build`

This will create a production-ready build of the application in the `build` folder.

**Running Tests**

To run the unit tests, run the following command:

`npm run test`

This will run the unit tests using Vitest.

`npm run test:ui`

This will run the unit tests using Vitest with the UI.
